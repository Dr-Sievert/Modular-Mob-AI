# Findings

What was learned the hard way, newest first. Read this before "fixing" something that looks odd: most of the odd things
are deliberate.

## Throughput and stability

- **Saving off also switched off chunk unloading.** `ServerLevelMixin` turns saving off while tests run, which removed an
  eighth of the server thread. But vanilla's `ChunkMap.tick` skips its whole unload pass for a level that doesn't save,
  so no chunk was ever let go.
  - As terrain sites moved on, a 1 GB worker filled its heap in minutes and spent most of its time in full collections
    (983 of them, 229 s of one worker's 10 minutes), then died of an `OutOfMemoryError`.
  - Because every worker waits for the slowest at the end of an iteration, one sick worker held up the whole run.
  - `ChunkMapMixin` now runs the unload pass without the save walk, and drops chunks without writing them. Live heap
    settles at about 950 MB, hence the 1.5 GB heap.
- **Moving sites on generates a lot of terrain.** Every move generates a site plus the half-generated ring around it:
  chunk holders reach 13 chunks out from each forced chunk. At 25 fights per site that kept a worker's spare cores busy,
  so sites now host 100.
- **Windows refuses a rename while anyone reads the file.** `scripts\watch.ps1` read `trainer.status` at the moment the
  trainer renamed a new one over it, and the trainer died of a `PermissionError`. All the trainer's renames now retry
  (`mmai/files.py`).
- **Git corrupted the first published models.** The repository's `* text eol=lf` rule rewrote CR LF byte pairs inside
  `.mbw` and `.pt` files. They're binary in `.gitattributes` now.
- **Two builds for one run killed each other.** Starting a run cleans up leftover trainers from crashes, so a second start
  killed the live one. Starting a run that's already training is now refused.
- **The machine blue-screened under load (2026-09-11).** The i7-14700KF was on microcode 0x11F, below Intel's fix for
  13th and 14th gen instability (0x12B). A BIOS update (A.K0, microcode 0x137) fixed it; crashes since are code bugs.

## Mechanics (a player's rules, and bugs that broke them)

- **Forward movement did nothing before commit c38efe9.** Vanilla's `Mob.setSpeed` also writes the forward input, and it
  ran after the agent's. The agent crept at a tenth of walking pace (strafing worked).
  - Jumping only worked on the ground, so it drowned in deep water.
  - The terrain grid saw grass as walls and water as ground.
  - Everything learned before that fix was learned in a broken body.
- **Swings at plants.** A player's swing breaks grass and flowers and costs no cooldown; the agent's swings used to stop
  at a fern. A swing into a block now never resets the attack cooldown, and instant-break blocks break.
- **Traps count as solid** in the terrain grid: powder snow, sweet berry bushes, cobwebs, lava.
- **Air control is a player's:** 0.026 while sprinting.
- **Paid by the health actually removed**, so overkill on a nearly dead vindicator pays no more.
- **Placing was broken** before the mechanics work: blocks always faced north, and wall-mounted blocks and axe use
  threw exceptions.
- **Open sky at spawn.** Fights that started under canopies or mangrove roots lost 9.8% against 0.8%: a fighter could be
  boxed in before it took a step.

## Learning

- **PPO made a good copy worse, twice.** A policy near its best has little to gain from a critic that hasn't learned the
  fight yet, and much to lose. What fixed it (`-FromCopy`):
  - 4x the experience per update, and smaller, bounded steps;
  - a longer critic warm-up;
  - little exploration;
  - a pull back towards the teacher's answers.

  With those, vindicator4 (97.9%) became vs-copy at 99.8%.
- **Judge by evaluation, not by the training win rate.** Twice the training win rate rose while the deployed fighter got
  worse: training explores, and PPO learns to cope with its own jitter. Hence evaluation inside the run, on the most
  likely action.
- **Aim noise has to be small.** At a spread of 0.37 of full deflection the crosshair jerked about 22 degrees a tick, and
  the sampled copy won about 1% against 63% on its most likely action. Aim now has its own, much narrower spread.
- **A copy needs to have seen mistakes (DART),** and above all **the copy driving while the teacher labels (DAgger).**
  Three DAgger rounds took a copy from 48.8% to 89.8%.
- **The teacher's record needs little noise.** At 0.2 the scripted fighter won only 11% of its recorded fights, and a
  record of a fighter losing is mostly positions nobody should be in. 0.1 works.
- **From nothing, it learns slowly but it learns.** With real movement and the current reward, vs-scratch went from 0%
  to 78.6% evaluated in about 650 iterations. Before the movement fix it learned nothing in 10,000 battles.
- **Never pay for surviving.** Any reward for lasting longer made running away the best thing an agent that couldn't yet
  win could do.
- **The scripted teacher's own ceiling.** 98.6% on terrain. What it still loses is mostly forest and mangrove ground:
  getting caught under cover, or a target stuck in a pit (it now drops down to one up to 9 blocks).
